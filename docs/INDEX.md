[SPHERE.IO](http://sphere.io/) is the first **Platform-as-a-Service** solution for eCommerce.

Officially supported Node.js SDK library for working with the SPHERE.IO HTTP API, with OAuth2 support.

## Introduction
The SDK exposes some libraries which can be either used alone or together:

- `SphereClient` - a high-level (promise-based) client to connect to the SPHERE.IO HTTP APIs
- `Rest` - a low-level (callback-based) client to connect to the SPHERE.IO HTTP APIs
- `*Sync` - a collection of utils to build update actions
