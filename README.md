### Installation

To install the latest `alpha` version:

```
npm install --save sphere-node-sdk@">2.0.0-alpha"
```

This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.
If you don't, you can [access these files on npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com/sphere-node-sdk/), download them, or point your package manager to them.

Usually this library is consumed as a collection of [CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) modules. These modules are what you get when you import `sphere-node-sdk` in a [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), or a Node environment.

If you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The `sphere-node-sdk` npm package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://npmcdn.com/sphere-node-sdk/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://npmcdn.com/sphere-node-sdk/dist/sphere-node-sdk.js) on the page. The UMD builds make SphereClient available as a `window.SphereClient` global variable.
