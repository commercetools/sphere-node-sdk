[commercetools](https://commercetools.com/) is a cloud-based commerce platform.

Officially supported Node.js SDK library for working with the commercetools<span>&trade;</span> platform HTTP API, with OAuth2 support.

> We are working on a [`v2.0`](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-node-sdk/tree/rewrite-2.0) version, [more info](docs/MIGRATION-2.0.md) coming soon.

## Getting Started
Install the module with `npm install sphere-node-sdk`

## Documentation
Check out the [JSDoc](http://sphereio.github.io/sphere-node-sdk/).

The module exposes some libraries which can be either used alone or together

- `SphereClient` - a high-level (promise-based) client to connect to the SPHERE.IO HTTP APIs
- `Rest` - a low-level (callback-based) client to connect to the SPHERE.IO HTTP APIs
- `*Sync` - a collection of utils to build update actions
